# Hackathon-Project

### prompt: Design a project focused on transitions
#### The problem of focus: Technology can do alot, but it can't make a person pursue their dreams for them. How can the technology we have help us transition into a healthier lifestyle?
### Solution: A health tracker that quantifies the users progress 
#### This solutions is to aid those that are afraid that they will stray from the path of progress

The solution for the prompt is simple, track the progress made by the user and return a graph of the data collected. This project is to be process oriented, not focused on the resut as the result comes naturally if new habits are developed.

What is the data that the program collects?
- The program collects the emotions of the users based on the changes the want to implement to complete their transition into a healthier lifestyle.
 <br> *This part of the program is to be insterfaced with gpt 4 as the semantic langauge model can more accurately gauge the emotional words used by the user to describe their journey to forming new habits*

How does this program collect data?
- The program will rely of the users' honesty and consistency to update their daily progress.
*The future of this project will also incorporte the time that the users update their account as a daily routine encourages consitency*

Why should people use this app?
- Quantifying progress is very important to facilitate transitions. Allowing users to see how far they have come can provide the proper contrast that one needs to realize the progress they have made.

## Innnovation: 
The choice to transition into a healthier lifestyle is a choice made everyday by a person. The daily use of the app will encourage the user to see the results of their daily choices imediately, as habits are often unseen by the person that has that habit. 

## Future of the project:
The most significant element in progress is accountanility, a way to 'socialize' to other people can encourage more mass of people to pursue a healthier lifestyle creating a new wave of a postive realtionship between social apps and users.
